# Animation Driven Character Controller (ADCC)

This is a modular, relatively simple to use character controller, suited for 3rd person characters.

Making an animation with its own Movement State (i.e. walking, sliding, etc.)
is as easy as adding the animation clip, connecting it with a transition, and 
asking the character to QueueAnimation.

### Features:
	- Easy-ish setup
	- Automatic AnimatorController property setup
	- Easy control
	- Animation tree
	- Animation chaining
	- Per-animation movement types
	- Example scene
